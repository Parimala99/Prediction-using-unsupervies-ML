# Prediction-using-unsupervies-ML

In this project , I have tried to predict whether a certain iris flower belongs to Setosa, Versicolor or Virginica class. I have used K means clustering technique to do so.
Libraries like seaborn,pandas,numpy and matplotlib are used for analysis and visualization of data. The data is take from the module datasets from seaborn. I have used elbow method to determine k value. I have also visualized the clustures and their centroids.For futher understanding , Kindly check the code.
